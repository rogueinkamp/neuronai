# Prototype of Neuron AI

## Small neuron-like structs created in Rust, communicating over simple Neuron Communication Protocol (TCP Sockets)


:warning: **This is not meant to be used in any kind of production system**: This is a prototype only

    Build scalable small interconnected distributed "neurons" that can perform machine learning operations dynamically,
    learn from one another, create small "knowledge" pools. Much like the brain.
